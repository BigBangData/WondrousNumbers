# Wondrous Numbers

Wondrous numbers are defined thus:
- Start with an arbitrary natural number. 
- If the number is even, divide it by 2. If it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. 
- Repeat until you come out with 1. A number is wondrous if and only if it eventually reaches 1 through this process.

__Programming assignments__
1. Create a programme which takes one scalar argument x, and tells you whether or not x is wondrous, and if it is, how many operations did it take to reach 1.
2. Create a programme which takes one scalar argument x. Assuming all numbers are wondrous, it plots the sequence of numbers in their trajectory to reach 1.
3. Create a programme which takes one numeric vector argument, and makes a line plot of the number of operations to reach 1 for each of the vector's elements.
4. Create any programme you wish that expands on the previous programmes and wondrously exceeds all expectations.
